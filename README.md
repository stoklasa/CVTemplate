# CVTemplate
Single-page pure JS/HTML app for CV creation. Free to use for anyone.

Created from need to keep up my resume and as a coding practice.
In future i plan to create easier templating and more CSS templates. Probably will end up with folders of css styles, but the initial idea is to create single document attachable directly to email while also demonstrating my coding/design* skills.

* design is not my strongest
